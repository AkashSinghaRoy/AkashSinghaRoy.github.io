# About
Welcome! 

I am a final year PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at the [University of Georgia](https://www.math.uga.edu/), working under the direction of [Prof. Paul Pollack](https://pollack.uga.edu/). I completed my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science at the Chennai Mathematical Institute. 

## Research Interests

My research interests lie primarily in the areas of elementary, analytic, combinatorial and algebraic number theory. Much of my current research is on the elementary/analytic side of number theory, focusing on value distributions and mean values of arithmetic functions, with emphasis on distributions along arithmetic progresssions. However I am also highly interested in a broad range of questions from the "anatomy of integers", Erdos-type problems and other statistical questions on arithmetic functions (such as popular values and Benford's Law).
