Welcome! 

I am a final year PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Georgia. 

My research interests lie primarily in the areas of elementary, analytic, combinatorial and algebraic number theory. Much of my current research is on the elementary/analytic side of number theory, focusing on value distributions and mean values of arithmetic functions, with emphasis on distributions along arithmetic progresssions. However I am also highly interested in a broad range of questions from the "anatomy of integers", Erdos-type problems and other statistical questions on arithmetic functions (such as popular values and Benford's Law).
