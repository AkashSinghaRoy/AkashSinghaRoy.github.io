# IMPORTANT UPDATE
Starting from October 2025, I will be a postdoctoral fellow in the number theory research group [UFOCLAN](https://www1.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~kala/web/ufoclan) at Charles University, Prague. My UGA directory page (https://www.math.uga.edu/directory/people/akash-singha-roy) may stop existing, so my most recent updates (especially research updates) will be present only on this website. My UGA email (Akash.SinghaRoy@uga.edu) will stop being valid within a few months as well, however I will continue to regularly check my permanent email: **akash01s.roy@gmail.com**.    

# About
Welcome! 

As of July 2025, I have completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the [University of Georgia](https://www.math.uga.edu/) under the direction of [Paul Pollack](https://pollack.uga.edu/). I completed my undergraduate studies at the Chennai Mathematical Institute in July 2021, where I obtained a BSc. Honors in Mathematics and Computer Science.

## Research Interests

<!--My research interests lie primarily in the areas of elementary, analytic, combinatorial and algebraic number theory. Much of my current research is on the elementary/analytic side of number theory, focusing on value distributions and mean values of arithmetic functions, with emphasis on distributions along arithmetic progresssions. However I am also highly interested in a broad range of questions from the "anatomy of integers", Erdos-type problems and other statistical questions on arithmetic functions (such as popular values and Benford's Law).-->

<!-- My primary research interests lie in elementary, analytic and combinatorial number theory. In my thesis, I obtain new results on the distribution in arithmetic progressions of values taken by arithmetic functions: This was born out of a series of joint papers with [my advisor](https://pollack.uga.edu/) and his former student Dr. [Noah Lebowitz-Lockard](https://noahlockard.wordpress.com/), -- where we had set out to investigate analogues of the Siegel-Walfisz theorem for large classes of additive and multiplicative functions as well as for the joint distribution of families consisting of such functions, -- and recently culminated in three solo papers obtaining some of the best possible results in this direction.-->

My primary research interests lie in elementary, analytic and combinatorial number theory. In my thesis, I study the residue-class distribution of (families of) arithmetic functions to varying moduli: More precisely, I obtain new analogues of the Siegel-Walfisz theorem for large classes of additive and multiplicative functions, which are essentially optimal in many ways. This work blends ideas that could be thought of as being borrowed from probability (but executed via the "anatomy of integers") with machinery from linear algebra over rings (a.k.a. module theory), classical analytic number theory, character sums/exponential sums, commutative algebra, as well as arithmetic and algebraic geometry. 

I am currently working on a variety of new projects. In one of these projects (which is almost complete!), I give new results on mean values of multiplicative functions that extend the classical Landau-Selberg-Delange "LSD" method to situations where the Dirichlet series under consideration is controlled by Dirichlet $L$-functions mod $q$ (instead of the usual Riemann zeta function), allowing the conductor $q$ to vary within ranges that are typically wider than those permitted by known forms of the "LSD" method. More updates on other projects coming soon!

Besides these, I have coauthored papers with [Vorrapan (Fai) Chandee](https://www.math.ksu.edu/~chandee/), [Xiannan Li](https://www.math.ksu.edu/~xiannan/), [Nathan McNew](https://www.nathanmcnew.com/) and [Paul Pollack](https://pollack.uga.edu/), on topics such as Benford's law (studying this phenomenon for various sequences of interest  such as Hecke eigenvalues of newforms), distributions of intermediate prime factors, and the behavior of the "aliquot sum" function $s(n)$. I am also interested in a variety of other questions on the anatomy of integers, Erdos-type problems and general statistical questions on distributions of arithmetic functions, including Fourier coefficients of modular forms and the partition function. 

<!-- Moreover, my work relies heavily on character sums and exponential sums, and many of the questions I have worked on and am working on have interesting analogues in the realms of $L$-functions, modular forms (and more generally automorphic forms), probability and probabilistic number theory. As part of my research, I have used multiple mathematical software packages such as Sage, Pari/GP, Macaulay2, and Magma.-->

I am the 2024 recipient of the William Armor Wills Memorial Scholarship Award from the Department of Mathematics at the University of Georgia.
